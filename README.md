# Recursion

This repository contains examples of recursive algorithms in various programming languages.

## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a powerful technique that breaks down complex problems into simpler, more manageable subproblems.

Examples

- Factorial Calculation: Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- Fibonacci Sequence: Generating the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
- Palindrome Checking: Recursive function to check if a word is a palindrome.
